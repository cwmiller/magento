# Magento Release Archive

This repo contains all production Magento releases (i.e. not beta or rc builds).
The intention is that you can use the version history in a couple of ways:

- To create a patch file to upgrade to a newer version
- To revert an upgrade to get back to a previous version
- To use log or blame to see in what releases files were changed

Hope it helps!
